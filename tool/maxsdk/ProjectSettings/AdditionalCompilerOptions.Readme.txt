:: April.26.2007 ::
The AdditionalCompilerOptions[64].txt files are meant to facilitate changes in 
compiler settings that should affect all project files.

AdditionalCompilerOptions.txt and AdditionalCompilerOptions64.txt are included 
by all project files. The first is referenced by all x32 project configurations, 
while the second by all x64 configurations.

Note that the VS 2005 C++ compiler does not allow for comments in these text files.

:: List of compiler flags ::
/GR - Enables Runtime-Type Information - As of 3ds Max 2009, all modules of 3ds Max
including 3rd party plugins must be compiled with RTTI On

:: List of warnings that are enabled or promoted to errors ::
C4706 - error - assignment within conditional expression
C4390 - error - ';' : empty controlled statement found; is this the intent?
C4557 - error - __assume' contains effect 'effect'
C4546 - error - function call before comma missing argument list
C4545 - error - expression before comma evaluates to a function which is missing an argument list
C4295 - error - 'array' : array is too small to include a terminating null character
C4310 - error - cast truncates constant value
C4130 - error - 'operator' : logical operation on address of string constant. Example:
	char* pc = "Hello";
	if (pc == "Hello") // C4130
C4611 - error - interaction between 'function' and C++ object destruction is non-portable
C4213 - error - nonstandard extension used : cast on l-value
C4121 - error - 'symbol' : alignment of a member was sensitive to packing

:: List of warnings that are disabled ::
C4244 - disabled - 'argument' : conversion from 'type1' to 'type2', possible loss 
of data. Reason: generates many false positives such as when an int is converted to a float.
C4018 - disabled - 'expression' : signed/unsigned mismatch. Reason: Max code has too many of them
