//!An interface class to manage access to various parameters used by DirectX effects.
/*!
 The Effect file has many internal presentations and as such the DxMaterial does not always store a 
 one to one look up.  Many parameters are stored in the ParamBlock and can be accessed that way.  The 
 paramblock index for the Effect is located at 0 (the material maintains 5 ParamBlocks).  However things like Lights
 and Bitmaps do not get stored in the paramblock in an ideal way for data access.  This interface simplifies this data
 access by providing direct access to these elements.
