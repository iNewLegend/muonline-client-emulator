//!A simple access class for controllers.
/*! IGameControl provides a simplified access to the various key frame controllers used throughout max.  In max a controller
needs to be queried for the key interface and then its class ID checked before casting to the approriate Key class.  This class
provide the developer with all the keys based on the key type being asked for.  As the game engine may only support certain type 
of max controllers it is far more efficient for a developer to ask IGame for all the Bezier Postion keys then to check wtith max for 
the controller type.  This class also provides direct support for Euler Rotation controllers.  The developer can use GetControlType
to see if the rotation is Euler and can then can use IGAME_EULER_X in the approprate control access type to retrieve the keys.
\br
In 3ds max some controllers such as TCB, Linear and Bezier support direct access to their keys.  Other controllers are more private
and usually base them selves on a float or Point3 controller.  If there is no direct access then sampling is the easiest choice.  IGame
supports two types - Full and Quick.  Full samples across the full animation range, whilst Quick only samples where keys are found.  The 
limitation of Quick, is that it does not support IGAME_TM or controllers that do not set keys.
